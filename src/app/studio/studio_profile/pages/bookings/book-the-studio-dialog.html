  <h3>Develop across all platforms</h3>
  <p>Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build
    apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.</p>

  <h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
  <p>Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web
    Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge
    data requirements by building data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.</p>

  <h3>Incredible tooling</h3>
  <p>Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with
    your own components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific
    help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus
    on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>
